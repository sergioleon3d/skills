# Release and push to production

An app must be versioned to be installed via a git/App Store/GitHub descriptor at all — Toolkit
resolves `version:` against git tags, so every release needs one. Use semantic versioning
(`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, e.g. start at `v0.1.0` during early development, `v1.0.0` for the first
production-ready release) and bump it for every change you want the config to be able to pin to.

Tag a version in git (e.g. `v1.0.0`), then switch the sandbox back from dev mode to the tagged
git descriptor:

```bash
./tank switch_app shot_step tk-maya tk-multi-mynewapp user@remotehost:/path_to/tk-multi-mynewapp.git
```

Toolkit will pick up the highest-numbered tag. Finally, push the sandbox's config changes to the
project's primary production configuration:

```bash
./tank push_configuration
```

Other descriptor types are available for the final `location` entry besides a git tag — App Store,
GitHub releases, or a Shotgun-uploaded attachment — pick whichever matches how the studio
distributes Toolkit apps.

Descriptor choice for this final release step also differs by the project's config type (see
[locating-config.md](locating-config.md) if you haven't determined that yet):

## Centralized config

A git descriptor works well here — one admin runs the update and the resolved code is cached once,
in a location every user already shares. See [centralized-config.md](centralized-config.md) for
more on this layout.

## Distributed config

A git descriptor means every user's machine resolves and downloads it independently into their own
bundle cache, so each of them needs git installed and authenticated against your repo. An App Store
or Shotgun-uploaded descriptor avoids that per-user git dependency. See
[distributed-config.md](distributed-config.md) for more on this layout.

**Later, when you ship a new version:** bump the version manually in `app_locations.yml` (and
`core_api.yml` if it's a core update), or use the Desktop app's Project menu → "Check for
configs/core updates" to upgrade automatically, or use `tank` from the project's config, or the
update API — whichever fits the studio's workflow.
