# Agent Skills for Autodesk Platform Services

A collection of reusable AI agent skills for [Autodesk Platform Services](https://aps.autodesk.com) and Autodesk industry clouds like Flow, Forma and Fusion products. Each skill is a self-contained instruction set that teaches a coding agent how to perform a specific Autodesk API-related development task.

## Installation

Each skill is a folder inside [`skills/`](skills/) containing a `SKILL.md` file and optional supporting reference documents.

### Manual installation

Clone this repository and copy the skill folder to wherever your AI agent looks for skills. For example, for Claude Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autodesk-platform-services/skills.git
cp -r skills/aps-mcp-server-gen ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/acad-arx-wizard ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/flow-ptr-app ~/.claude/skills/
...
```

### Automated installation

Use the [skills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills) utility to install and manage skills globally or per project:

```bash
# Install all skills globally
npx skills add autodesk-platform-services/skills --global

# ... or ...
```

### acad-cuix-builder — one-shot install

One command installs both the skill and [`CuixBuilder.exe`](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/acad-cuix-builder/releases/latest):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autodesk-platform-services/skills/main/skills/acad-cuix-builder/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then in your agent:

```
/acad-cuix-builder

I need a ribbon tab called "Drafting Tools" with two panels:
  Panel 1 — Annotation: Quick Leader (QLEADER), Mtext (MTEXT)
  Panel 2 — View: Zoom Extents (ZOOM E), Regen (REGEN)
Save to C:\Plugins\DraftingTools.cuix
```
